Picture this: It's December. You're going home for the holidays in a few days, and you just realized your plants will die if left alone for those 6 weeks. You also recently (accidentally) inherited an [Adafruit Metro](https://www.adafruit.com/metro) that is just lying around. What do you do?

Well, if you're like me, you make an automatic plant waterer.

This is my spider plant, Carlotta. As of this writing (October 2020), I've become quite a plant mom, but in December 2019 she was my only plant child, and I was desperate to keep her alive. (Little did I know that a few months later, a certain virus would prevent me from returning from spring break, and Carlotta would somehow survive 3 months with no automatic plant watering whatsoever.) 

To make the plant waterer, I followed [this Instructables tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/Automatically-water-your-small-indoor-plant-using-/) very closely. Shoutout to user osmithy for helping me make my first Arduino project. In this project, I learned how to 
1. Wire up an Arduino
2. Hook up a pump correctly to the board
3. Use a transistor to protect the board from high voltage
4. Edit the simple Arduino program for my desired watering time and wait time between watering

I had a great time! And Carlotta survived, though clearly she would have come out unscathed even without the automatic waterer. 

You can find my code [here](https://gitlab.com/my-projects-sophiestephenson/personal/automatic-plant-waterer), though if you're thinking of making the project yourself, I'd recommend you check out the Instructables tutorial for the full instructions. 

Thanks for reading!
