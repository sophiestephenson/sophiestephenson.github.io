2048 is a fun little puzzle game. You've probably heard of it, but if you haven't, it involves combining tiles in the grid below. The goal is to eventually obtain the 2048 tile.

I recreated this game in Processing, partially for fun and partially to get practice using Processing. I'm writing this in October 2020, but in January 2019 when I made this, I had just finished my second-ever computer science class. I used Java for the first time in that class and was excited to try out my new skills on a fun project. 

My implementation consists of two classes, `Board` and `Tile`, and a main file `processing2048.pde` which runs the game. It's a little buggy, and the animation could use some cleaning; it was one of my first projects, though, so be nice! You can download and run the code for the game [here](https://gitlab.com/my-projects-sophiestephenson/personal/2048-in-processing).

That's about it. It's a simple project, but was definitely one of the steps to figuring out that I really, really like coding. Thanks for reading:)
